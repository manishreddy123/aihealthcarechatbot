Step 1: Importing Libraries

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries required for data preprocessing, classification models, and utility functions. The libraries imported include preprocessing from sklearn, as well as classifiers such as SVC (Support Vector Machine), GaussianNB (Naive Bayes), KNeighborsClassifier (K-Nearest Neighbors), and DecisionTreeClassifier (Decision Tree). Additionally, the code imports the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection, warnings for handling warning messages, time for controlling delays, and webbrowser for opening URLs.

        
Step 2: Utility Functions

The code defines two utility functions.
message(string) function is responsible for displaying messages character by character with a slight delay between each character, creating a typewriter effect.
openlink(url) function opens a provided URL in a new web browser tab.


Step 3: Ignoring Warnings

The code uses the warnings module to suppress the display of deprecation warnings. This ensures that the warnings related to deprecated functionality do not clutter the output.


Step 4: Loading and Preparing Data

The code reads the training and testing data from CSV files named Training.csv and Testing.csv, respectively, using the read_csv function. The training data is stored in a variable called training, and the testing data is stored in testing. The code then extracts the column names from the training data and assigns them to the cols variable. Since the last column contains the target variable (prognosis), cols is sliced to exclude the last column. The symptom columns are stored in the x variable, and the target variable column is stored in the y variable. Additionally, a copy of y is stored in y1. An empty list called user_symptoms is initialized to store the symptoms entered by the user later.


Step 5: Label Encoding
To convert the categorical target variable (prognosis) into numerical form, the code uses the LabelEncoder class from preprocessing. It initializes an instance of LabelEncoder as le and fits it to the target variable y using the fit method. The transform method is then used to encode the labels of y, and the encoded labels are stored back in y.


Step 6: Train-Test Split
To evaluate the performance of the trained models, the code splits the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. The feature data (x) and the target variable data (y) are passed to the function along with the test_size parameter set to 0.33, indicating that 33% of the data should be used for testing. The random seed (random_state) is set to 42 for reproducibility. The resulting splits are stored in x_train, x_test, y_train, and y_test variables.


Step 7: Training Classification Models
The code proceeds to train four different classification models using the training data:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): The code initializes an SVM classifier (clf_svm) with a linear kernel and trains it using the fit method, passing the training features (x_train) and the encoded target variable (y_train). The classifier's performance is evaluated using the score method on the testing data, and the accuracy score is stored in svm_score.

Naive Bayes: The code initializes a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (clf_nb) and trains it using the fit method. Similarly, the accuracy score is calculated and stored in nb_score.

K-Nearest Neighbors: The code initializes a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier (clf_knn) and trains it using the fit method. The accuracy score is calculated and stored in knn_score.

Decision Tree: The code initializes a Decision Tree classifier (tree) and trains it using the fit method. However, before training, the predictions from the SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors models on the training data are combined into a new DataFrame called model_predictions_train. This combined data serves as input to the Decision Tree classifier.


Step 8: User Interaction

The code prompts the user to enter their name and age using the input function. The name is stored in the name variable, and the age is stored in the age variable. The code then displays personalized healthy suggestions based on the user's age using the message function. The suggestions vary depending on the age range, providing advice related to drinking water, nutrition, sleep, stress management, exercise, and more.


Step 9: Greeting and Symptom Diagnosis

The code greets the user by printing a message using the message function, addressing the user by their name. It then asks the user to respond with "Yes" or "No" for each symptom in the dataset, indicating whether they are experiencing the symptom or not.


Step 10: Symptom Collection and Encoding

For each symptom, the code waits for the user's input. The user's response is converted to lowercase and checked. If the response is "Yes," the corresponding symptom is marked as present (1) in the symptoms_present list, and the symptom name is appended to the user_symptoms list. If the response is "No," the symptom is marked as absent (0). If the response is "Exit," the code breaks out of the symptom input loop. The symptoms_present list is converted to a DataFrame called symptoms_present, with the symptom names as column names.


Step 11: Model Predictions

The code uses the user's entered symptoms as input to the trained SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors models to obtain their predictions. These predictions are combined into a new DataFrame called model_predictions_test. This step allows the Decision Tree classifier to utilize the outputs of the other models as features for prediction.


Step 12: Final Prediction

The combined predictions from the previous step (model_predictions_test) are used as input to the trained Decision Tree classifier to predict the user's prognosis (disease). The predicted disease is stored in the tree_prediction variable. The code then retrieves the row from the dataset that matches the predicted disease and stores it in row1. Additionally, the code retrieves the corresponding definition and stores it in row2, and the doctor's information is stored in row3.


Step 13: Output and Recommendations

The code displays the symptoms entered by the user using the message function. It then simulates data collection and analysis processes by printing messages with delays. After that, the predicted disease and its definition are displayed using the message function.


Step 14: Preventive Suggestions

The code prints suggestions to prevent the further growth of the disease based on the predicted disease. It displays four suggestions using the message function, extracted from the row1 DataFrame. These suggestions may include lifestyle changes, dietary recommendations, exercise, or other preventive measures.


Step 15: Doctor Recommendation

The code suggests the user consult a doctor and recommends a specific doctor by displaying the doctor's name using the message function. It also uses the openlink function to open a web browser tab with the doctor's page, accessed through the URL provided in the dataset (row3['link'].values[0]).


The code involves data loading, preprocessing, training classification models, user interaction, symptom diagnosis, prediction, output display, and recommendations. The code aims to provide personalized health suggestions, diagnose symptoms based on user input, predict diseases, and offer preventive measures and doctor recommendations accordingly.
